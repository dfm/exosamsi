A list of the existing detrending algorithms
============================================

A lot of people have their own codes for detrending Kepler light curves. Let's
assemble a list here with links and make sure that we can fun all of them.

1. MAP-PDC: this is (I think) already available in the Kepler data products.
2. [Untrendy](https://github.com/dfm/untrendy): cubic spline + iteratively
   re-weighted least-squares + variable complexity. Python + C.
3. Others...
