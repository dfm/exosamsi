Agenda for 09:00 "office hours"
-------------------------------

1. What data should reside in a detrending testbed?
2. What objective(s) should be used to assess "success" in the testbed?
3. What do we mean by "noise model"?
4. What things do we need to know about the noise to write a (better) likelihood function?
5. Discussion of physical effects that might be relevant to generating instrumental variations.
6. Descope to "achievable but important".

talking points from Hogg
------------------------
1. Clean, barely variable stars with and without inserted transits.
2. Unambiguous detection (or ruling out) of Earth-like planets.
3. p(Delta), where Delta is a residual away from a *sensible* fit, possibly conditional on nearby Deltas, etc.
4. *(the same)*
5. There is some hope that instrumental variations, because they are small, can be linearized and fit with a matrix factorization (PCA-like).  This would make Hogg's day.

Agenda for "rest of day"
------------------------
* continue discussion topics above
* look at plots of one-point and two-point properties of noise
* discuss separation of instrumental and astrophysical trends
* discuss constraints if we are going to insist on *simultaneous* trend and transit fitting
* what did we learn from our reading assignments?
* beer run (have established refrigerator access)
