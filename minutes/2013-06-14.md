* Barclay: thinking about how to model transit timing variations approximately/simply
  in relation to sampling and search.
* Dawson: *wavelets*. "Mother" wavelet: step function, "father" wavelet: box. Somewhat
  unsure about the usefulness of this method. Intuition is that this will reduce to BLS.
* Baines: agrees. The box needs to be a *very* good model of the transit in order to 
  light up on a transit. Can we save ourselves by **math**? Priors?
