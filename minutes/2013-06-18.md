* Baines: likelihood function. Need a "conservative" de trending algorithm
  with a funny definition. It needs to flatten the signal as much as possible
  but not touch the transits. It should leave more noise in favor of transit
  depths
* Hogg: how about including a dictionary of possible artifacts in likelihood
  function to fit the extra noise that isn't dealt with by detrending
* Barclay: why not cut out a chunk of data around time gaps/discontinuities
* Broadbent: what about the data gaps? Do we need to impute? Don't transits
  need to be evenly spaced
  - Hogg/Baines: still deciding on the best way to deal with this. Either
    impute or develop an algorithm that works with non-uniformly spaced data
* Wolpert: we will have other stellar types in our sample (not just G-type)
  what will that do?
  - Gal: yes. Finding a good range in the color-color plot is hard (especially
    because our goals are poorly defined). If we can do all the "G"-stars then
    it's not too hard but coming up with a priority list.


Goals
-----

* Need a conservative de-trender
* Need 1-d injections as a test
