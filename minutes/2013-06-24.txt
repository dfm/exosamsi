Minutes, Monday 24th June. 

List of potential papers

1. Detrending paper - technique comparison. 
    - New detrending methods (polynomial + transit, notched median filter)
    - 10,000 stars in Gal's sample have been detrended. Dan injected planets into these lcs.
    - Gal is going to detrend Bekki's stars.
    - Billy / Ben to write this up

2. Detections / limits on a subset of stars. 
   - Gal's sample, planets with planets already detected (Bekki's sample)
   - Earth-like detections
   - Ruth / Bekki to write this up

3. Fitting / detrending using wavelets and GPs. 
   - Hannu to (jointly?) write this up

4. Wavelet likelihood function.
   - Baines writing up?

SAMPLES

Gal's sample - detrending/gtype
    - List of KIC numbers for stars lying in a circle in colour - colour space around the sun
    -Link to Dan's detrended / injection version of Gal's stars. 

detrending / sandbox/ README
    - Jessie's sample.

Tom injected into Gal's and Jessie's sample. 
Dan only injected into gal's sample. 

Bekki's sample all have planets already.

Mary-Beth to give a tutorial on Gaussian Processes, Ruth will make some plots/ maybe run through some code.

Bekki will give a tutorial on wavelets. 

Everyone is going to put an outline of their paper/section on Github later today.
